#FantaSport
During the last session, I will make sure that you've almost finished the app and that you fully master the code you're presenting. Be aware that failing during the presentation would automatically lead to getting a mark below average for the project !



The goal of this "project" is to deliver a sporting app that would enable coaches to save significant information about matches and debrief objectively using statistics with their players.

A good app to look up that I know about is "tennis tracker".

Design constraints :

1- ergnomic interface (use fragments, menus like toolbars and navigation drawers, ...)

2- locate the matches (latitude, longitude and geocoding - transform these into a street name)

3- take pictures of the match and save them locally

4- save statistics locally for 5 previous matches (in a sqlite database)

5- save full statistics on a real external database 

6- be able to display information about any previous match (read the information from the local databse or the distant one)

7- discover nearby mobiles and start chatting (bonus)

8- UP TO YOU TO DEFINE MORE FUNCTIONS   



Submit your work here (name1_name2.zip) :

1- a report describing the functionnalities of your app, how you implemented it and possible improvements

2- your app code

In case you project is too big to upload here, just submit the java files + XML resources (Layouts, strings) + Manifest.
